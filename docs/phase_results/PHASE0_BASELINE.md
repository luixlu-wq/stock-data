# Phase 0: Baseline Performance

**Establish baseline with Buy & Hold strategy**

## Objective

Establish performance benchmark before applying machine learning.

## Approach

Simple equal-weighted buy-and-hold portfolio of all universe stocks.

## Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Sharpe Ratio** | 0.42 |
| **Annual Return** | 8.5% |
| **Volatility** | 20.1% |
| **Max Drawdown** | -18.2% |

## Interpretation

- Baseline Sharpe 0.42 represents market performance
- High volatility (20%) and drawdown (-18%)
- **Goal for ML**: Beat Sharpe 0.42

## Status

✅ **Complete** - Baseline established
